                <p>Hey there! I'm Nick DiRienzo. I'm a second year computer science student at <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">SUNY Buffalo</a>. I'm not actually from near Western New York at all, but it's what I'll be calling home for the remaining two years. And yes, it does snow as much as people think it does.</p>
                <p>I'll start at the beginning, just like every other biography. To keep things short, though, I'll just skip to the interesting stuff. I started programming because of <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics</a> around the end of my second year of high school. I started in Python, which had nothing to do with FIRST, but the following year I started using Java more heavily in both classwork and on <a href="http://mort11.org/" target="_blank">MORT</a>.</p>
                <p>In college, I started developing some web applications. Nothing too fancy, really, but I learned a lot. I built on top of App Engine, then I moved to my own instances on Digital Ocean and EC2. Over my first year, I primarily developed in Python, but had to use Java for the introductory courses here. I also found out about these things called hackathons by seeing <a href="http://pennapps.com" target="_blank">PennApps</a> on the front page of HackerNews. I have never been to one, but they seemed awesome. I had this crazy idea of organizing one at my university, and with the help of the other <a href="http://acm.cse.buffalo.edu/" target="_blank">UB ACM</a> board members, it turned out rather successful. We called it <a href="http://ubhacking.com/" target="_blank">UB Hacking</a>. At the end of my first year, I had an opportunity to join <a href="http://www.google.com/jobs/students/proscho/programs/uscanada/fep/" target="_blank">Google</a> for a summer. It really is a great environment to work and grow as a software engineer.</p>
                <p>My second year at school was interesting, to say the least. I was president of UB ACM, and we started weekly tech talks, where engineers would come to campus to discuss the current state of the industry and the challenges they face. UB Hacking happened again, and was a huge success (I'll link to a post when I write it). I took some more interesting courses too. And I accepted a returning offer as a Software Engineering Intern at Google in Mountain View, CA for the summer of 2013.</p>
